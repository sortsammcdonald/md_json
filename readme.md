# Overview

Writing a programme that will extract data from blog entries and return a JSON file.

# 2024.09.24

Some slight progress. The header is now being extracted and added to its own file.

Next steps should be to create a readable object and then doing the processing on that.

Made some additional progress, the programme can now take a blog post and write the header material out in a seperate file.

## Next steps

- Extract the other sections of text and output them as seperate files
- Convert the output file to a diction 
- Merge seperate files into one file
- Append merged file to Main JSON file

Maybe I can modify some elements from the Markov proj to extract the Astro metadata and copyright info.
